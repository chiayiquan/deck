# Introduction

This is just for demo/inspiration on how to finish the DJ deck. The principle I followed is SRP(Single Responsibility Principle) and DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself).
SRP means that each function will only have a repsonsibility and will not have other side effect. DRY is to refactor code to be reusable so there won't be duplicate
maintainability of code.
